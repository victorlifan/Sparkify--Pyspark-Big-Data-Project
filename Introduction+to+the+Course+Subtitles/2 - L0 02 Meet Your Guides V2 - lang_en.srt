1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,710
Our goal for this course is to have

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,380
current and aspiring data scientists learn how

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,600
to work with large datasets using "Apache Spark."

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,830
We're both Data Engineers at Insight Data Science.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,080
We run a fellowship that helps programmers

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,295
learn big data technologies and distributed computing.

7
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:25,050
We work side-by-side with data scientists and

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,670
the entire data community to solve real-world problems.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,364
Learning Spark can be challenging.

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,410
We had been working with it as it has developed and have

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,895
hundreds of fellows learn Spark in the past couple of years.

12
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:40,670
We are excited to have you do the same.
