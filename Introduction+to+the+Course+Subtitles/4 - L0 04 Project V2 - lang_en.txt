00:00:00	Imagine you are working
00:00:08	on the data team for a popular digital music service similar to Spotify or Pandora.
00:00:13	Menus of users stream their favorite songs to your service every day either using
00:00:19	the free tier that place advertisements between
00:00:22	the songs or using the premium subscription model,
00:00:25	where they stream music as free but pay a monthly flat rate.
00:00:29	Users can upgrade, downgrade,
00:00:32	or cancel their service at any time.
00:00:34	So, it's crucial to make sure your users love the service.
00:00:38	Every time a user interacts with the service while they're playing songs, logging out,
00:00:43	like in a song with a thumbs up, hearing an ad,
00:00:46	or downgrading their service, it generates data.
00:00:49	All this data contains the key insights for
00:00:52	keeping your users happy and helping your business thrive.
00:00:55	It's your job on the data team to predict which users are at risk to
00:00:59	churn either downgrading from premium
00:01:01	to free tier or cancelling their service altogether.
00:01:04	If you can accurately identify these users before they leave,
00:01:08	your business can offer them discounts and incentives,
00:01:11	potentially saving your business millions in revenue.
00:01:14	To tackle this project,
00:01:16	we have provided you with a large dataset that contains the events David just described.
00:01:21	You will need to load,
00:01:23	explorer, and clean this dataset with Spark.
00:01:26	Based on your explanation,
00:01:27	you will create features and build models with Spark to
00:01:30	predict which users were churn from your digital music service.
00:01:34	This project is all about demonstrating mastery of
00:01:37	Spark scalable data manipulation and machine learning.
00:01:41	After completing this project,
00:01:43	you'll have built a useful model with a massive dataset.
00:01:46	You'll be able to apply the same skills with Spark to
00:01:49	wrangle data and build models in your role as a data scientist.
