1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
Imagine you are working

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,570
on the data team for a popular digital music service similar to Spotify or Pandora.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,320
Menus of users stream their favorite songs to your service every day either using

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,170
the free tier that place advertisements between

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,440
the songs or using the premium subscription model,

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,580
where they stream music as free but pay a monthly flat rate.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,275
Users can upgrade, downgrade,

8
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,380
or cancel their service at any time.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,825
So, it's crucial to make sure your users love the service.

10
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:43,755
Every time a user interacts with the service while they're playing songs, logging out,

11
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:46,425
like in a song with a thumbs up, hearing an ad,

12
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:49,600
or downgrading their service, it generates data.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,220
All this data contains the key insights for

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,370
keeping your users happy and helping your business thrive.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,270
It's your job on the data team to predict which users are at risk to

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,775
churn either downgrading from premium

17
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,855
to free tier or cancelling their service altogether.

18
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,780
If you can accurately identify these users before they leave,

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,570
your business can offer them discounts and incentives,

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,690
potentially saving your business millions in revenue.

21
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,620
To tackle this project,

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,725
we have provided you with a large dataset that contains the events David just described.

23
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,235
You will need to load,

24
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:26,015
explorer, and clean this dataset with Spark.

25
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:27,710
Based on your explanation,

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,560
you will create features and build models with Spark to

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,870
predict which users were churn from your digital music service.

28
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,940
This project is all about demonstrating mastery of

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,175
Spark scalable data manipulation and machine learning.

30
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:43,040
After completing this project,

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,310
you'll have built a useful model with a massive dataset.

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,460
You'll be able to apply the same skills with Spark to

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,570
wrangle data and build models in your role as a data scientist.
