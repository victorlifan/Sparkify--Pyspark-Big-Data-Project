1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,710
In this course, you will learn how to wrangle and model massive datasets with Pi Spark,

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,740
which is a Python library for interacting with Spark.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,470
We have divided the materials into four main parts.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,945
In the first lesson,

5
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:23,870
you will learn about big data and how Spark fits into the big data ecosystem.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,300
In lesson two, it will be practice processing and cleaning

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,505
datasets to get comfortable with Spark's SQL and dataframe APIs.

8
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,995
In the third lesson,

9
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:39,280
we will cover how to debug and optimize your Spark code when running on a cluster.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,460
Finally, in lesson four,

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,155
you will use Spark's Machine Learning Library to train machine learning models at scale.

12
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,330
Once you master these four necessary pieces,

13
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,170
you'll build a Spark program that solves a real-world problem predicting

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,715
the turn of users for a music streaming service like Spotify or Pandora.

15
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:02,570
You will have the opportunity to go above and beyond with this project.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,700
The provided dataset has plenty of options for creative feature engineering and modeling.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,250
We're glad that you're here and we hope you'll enjoy

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,830
learning about how to scale up your data analysis,

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,170
and machine learning projects. Let's get started
